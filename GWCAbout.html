          <p>Girls Who Code is a non-profit organization that aims 
            to close the gender gap in technology. It is a national 
            (verging on international) movement that works to support and 
            encourage women to enter the computer science field. Equipping 
            young women with skills, resources, and confidence, Girls Who Code 
            prepares girls, not just to enter the workforce, 
            but also to lead, improve, and absolutely transform it.

      <p>Anyone and everyone is welcome, regardless of experience! 
        We have a super informal setting where you can explore  programming 
        languages to your heart's content, work on programming projects, or 
        poke around to figure out what exactly computer science even is. 
        We meet in the Manley Project room every Monday from 3 to 4 pm. Come
        for the food, stay for the coding and people (and amazing food—don't 
        forget about the food)!</p> </div>

I studied electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton, graduating in 1983.
I learned a lot about designing circuits and took a few programming classes.
I joined Hewlett Packard after graduation. We wrote EDA software, which is used
by chip designers to verify that their wires and transistors meet spacing and width
rules so they can be manufactured reliably. HP sent me to get a master’s degree,
this time in computer science, at Stanford. I learned a lot more about computer
operating systems, data structures, and artificial intelligence. I kept working
on EDA software, because the problems to solve kept getting harder and more
interesting as chips grew from 200 thousand transistors to over a trillion.
Later, I joined Agilent Technologies, and then Cadence Design Systems. I’m a
Senior Architect for Cadence now, I and work on EDA software for custom design of
chips and systems. </p>

  I am so glad I’m teaching a GWC club at Notre Dame because I went to an all-girls
  Catholic high school in Philadelphia. We had no access at all to computers or
  programming, so I was a complete newbie when I took my first programming class
  at Princeton where there were very few women. Worse, there were quite a few
  guys who had already learned how to program and dominated class time with very
  advanced questions. Those of us who hadn’t done any programming in high school
  were terrified, and many dropped out, including all but 6 of the women in the
  department. However, those of us who stuck it out quickly caught up to the
  rest. That experience convinced me that learning to program in an environment
  designed to help students with little experience was critical. Girls Who Code
  provides that environment. I have been amazed at how well the more experienced
  programmers have helped and encouraged those new to coding. It’s such a
  supportive environment. I hope that girls who join our club will feel a
  sense of confidence when they take programming classes. The most important thing
  I hope they take away is that if they don’t understand something,
  it’s just a matter of learning it (and googling it)! </p>
