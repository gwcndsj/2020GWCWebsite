          <p>This is a maze game where you are playing as the mermaid. Your goal
            is to get to the shell to advance onto each new level. It was fun to
            create the layout of each level and code each sprite. Although, the
            hardest part was making sure that all the code matched up with exactly
            what I wanted it to do.

            <p>The game that I created is a maze-based game where you are a cat,
              and your owner has left you alone in his house for 100 seconds.
              Your goal is to destroy everything you can before your owner gets
              back, and if you destroy everything within the time limit then you win.
              Something challenging about creating the game was that I wasn't sure
              how to make it so the cat couldn't go through the maze walls, because
              before it could just walk through the lines I drew as if they weren't
              even there. Some interesting things about my game is that each item
              has a different animation when the cat touches it, which I think
              gives it a more realistic look instead of each object just
              disappearing like the game was originally designed. For example,
              clothing items become shredded and ripped, and a fishbowl falls off
              the table and spills water. Thanks for checking my game out!

              <p>Our game is an ND twist on the flappy bird game. Instead of a bird
                there is a girl's face and instead of pipes there are sunflowers.
                The goal of the game is to avoid the sunflowers. The most challenging
                part of this game was creating the rolling background.
